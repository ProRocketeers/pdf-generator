# Frontend

## Overview

The frontend of the application is built using React with Next.js, utilizing the App Router for routing and server components for better performance. The application leverages Vite for fast development and build processes.

The frontend is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with a focus on providing a seamless experience across different devices. The application uses Material-UI (MUI) for styling and components, ensuring a modern and consistent look and feel.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
